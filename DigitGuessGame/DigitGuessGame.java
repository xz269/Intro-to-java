 *  Description: The program generates a random number between 1 and 10. If the user input number matches the generated number, then the code prints a message to inform 
 *  users that he/she has a correct guess. If the guess is not correct, allow the user to have two more chances to guess the correct number. At any time, 
 *  if users enter 0, then the program should display the game summary and exits. The program keep track of the wins and losses and print the counts when user 
 *  chooses to exit by entering 0. The program should generate a new random number only after user enters the correct guess or after user has tried 3 times and did 
 *  not have the right guess.
